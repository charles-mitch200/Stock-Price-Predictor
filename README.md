# Stock Price Predictor
## Overview
Welcome to the Stock Price Predictor project! This repository houses a machine learning solution designed to predict stock prices based on historical data. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the system aims to assist investors and traders in making informed decisions regarding stock market movements.

## Dataset
The project utilizes a comprehensive dataset containing historical stock prices, trading volumes, and other relevant financial indicators. The dataset is carefully preprocessed to handle missing values, scale features, and create meaningful input representations for the machine learning models.

## Models
Various machine learning models are implemented for stock price prediction, including:
Linear Regression
Regularized Linear Models
Support Vector Machines (SVM). 
Model performance is evaluated based on metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to ensure accurate and reliable predictions.

## Results
The project includes visualizations and analyses of model predictions against actual stock prices. Performance metrics are provided to help users assess the reliability of the stock price predictor in different market conditions.
